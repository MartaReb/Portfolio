### About me

######<p>Hi, my name is Marta üôÇ I am in the process of changing my career to become a software tester.</p>
<p>In my previous job, I worked as a technical inspector for aviation parts at an aircraft maintenance company. My responsibilities included conducting entry inspections of the parts and verifying the accuracy of their documentation. Additionally, I was responsible for filing complaints and reporting any anomalies discovered to the internal system.<p>
<p>I have a strong enthusiasm for learning new things and enjoy setting and achieving goals. Continuously developing my testing knowledge and technical skills is a priority for me. In the future, I aspire to advance my career in the field of automation testing.</p>
<p>In my portfolio I would like to showcase my abilities and credentials, things I have learned, tools that I use and sources of my current knowledge.</p>

### Manual testing projects
As part of the "Dare IT Portfolio Challenge: Zosta≈Ñ Testerem Manualnym" course, I manually tested the following applications:
- [Panel Skautingowy](https://scouts.futbolkolektyw.pl/en/login?redirected=true) - an application for football scouts to view player metrics, skills, and positions,
- [Pick Eat Up](https://pickeatup.io/) - an application which allows users to order surprise-packages of surplus food from local venues in the area,
- [Focusly](https://focusly.co/) - an application for meditation, development and stress reduction.

The documentation that was created as part of the testing process is below.

### Automated testing projects
Automated tests were created for the Scouts Panel application as part of the "Dare IT Challenge: Wstƒôp do Test√≥w Automatycznych" course. The tests were written using Selenium WebDriver with Python and also in Robot Framework. As part of the testing process, I created documentation that includes the test cases, the bug reports and the test report.
