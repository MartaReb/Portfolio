## Manual Testing
As part of the "Dare IT Portfolio Challenge: Zostań Testerem Manualnym" course, I manually tested the following applications:
- Scouting Panel - an application for football scouts to view player metrics, skills, and positions,
- Pick It Up - an application which allows users to order surprise-packages of surplus food from local venues in the area,
- Focusly - an application for meditation, development and stress reduction.
The documentation that was created as part of the testing process is below.

### My testing documentation examples:
  - **Test cases:**

  ## Automated Testing:
Automated tests were created for the Scouts Panel application as part of the "Dare IT Challenge: Wstęp do Testów Automatycznych" course.  The tests were written using Selenium WebDriver with Python and also in Robot Framework. As part of the testing process, I created documentation that includes test cases, bug reports, and a test report.
